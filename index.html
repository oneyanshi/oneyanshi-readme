                    <p class="lead text">my name's yan shi, and i'm the digital media data specialist at afscme. last updated: 6/7/2019.</p>

            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">my role @ afscme</h3>
                <p >the <strong>tl;dr</strong> is that i handle etl (extract, transform, load) processes for our digital media data resources, which includes action network, mobile commons, 
                hustle, etc. i build pipelines and help ensure the health of them with my teammates! sometimes you'll also see me leading workshops on sql.</p> 
            
                <p><strong>the longer story:</strong> here at afscme, i wear a lot of hats, but my primary hat is to essentially fill in the role of a data engineer. data has to come in one way or another, 
                and i help in designing the processes that help get things from point A to point D, our data warehouse. i'm still learning how to fill in those big shoes, so i'm grateful 
                that there are folks on my team that are also learning alongside me -- it's an exciting time to be a part of an organization, more specifically a department that is gungho 
                about technological processes and progress. </p>

                <p>my toolbox varies, but i build primarily using python3, sql, and aws redshift. my tickets in jira vary from all things pipelines to web scraping requests to presentations and workshops 
                that i may be leading!</p>

            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">communication methods</h3>
                <p>i have a strong preference towards slack if you want to reach me quickly about troubleshooting code, lunch, etc. please note that i do NOT have slack on my phone.
                otherwise, email is a fine method too for longer requests, questions, etc. i <em>do</em> have my work email on my phone.
                </p>

                <p>additionally, i also like talking in person! if i have my headphones in, please just knock on my cube. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">goal-setting & frameworks</h3>
                <p>in any meeting, gathering, etc., i generally want to make sure that all parties at the table understand what's going on, why we're doing what we're doing, 
                    and whether or not that reason makes sense in the context of the work, purpose, etc., that we've decided on. during that time, i also want to make sure to set 
                    expectations to an appropriate level, e.g. possible things vs nice things to have vs actually impossible. 
                </p>
                <p>i like knowing what's expected of me, deadlines that i have to meet, etc., and am grateful for when stakeholders are decisive about what they want and when they 
                    want the deliverable, as it helps me plan and set goals for myself to meet those demands. with all of that, i also prefer flexibility over stringency. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">howto: working with yan</h3>
                <p>i think i'm a friendly, approachable person. i do best in small groups / talk more often in smaller groups, but put me in a room full of people and i'm likely to 
                keep to myself -- but don't interpret that as non-engagement or passiveness. i like taking notes during meetings, and i ask questions when things are unclear or 
                require clarification. i'll ask the "stupid, obvious" questions because those matter, too, and sometimes i'll make you repeat yourself (i'm only mildly sorry, but 
                things sometimes need to be said twice for it to click, and it forces the other parties to reword and rethink what they're saying). 
                </p>

                <p>sometimes i'll get pretty obsessive over a task, which is a habit that is both good and bad at its core (oops). i'm generally flexible with deadlines and prefer to make them 
                earlier dates versus later dates to allow for breathing room in case Something Terrible Happens (TM). i value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber ducking</a> 
                and collaboration. i own my work and i expect others to take ownership of their own work, too. i'll respect your time and be as prepared as i can be, so please respect mine, too.   
                </p>

                <p>i'm not a huge fan of passive aggressiveness or tactics like that, as it makes me very anxious. i try to be as transparent as possible and, just as i'll own my wins, succeess, etc., i'll also 
                own my failures and mistakes... and i expect folks to do the same. 
                </p>

            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">the feedback loop</h3>
                <p>feedback helps me and others around me become better and work towards becoming better versions of ourselves. i prefer it written, but verbal is also good -- i also prefer feedback in a one on one 
                    versus in a group setting. 
                </p>
            </div>        
        
            <div class="container text">
                <h3 class="headers">on a personal level</h3>
                <p>please keep in mind that i do have boundaries, and that i may not always be open to talking about certain things, etc., but that doesn't mean that i'm unfriendly or that i dislike you! that being said, 
                    i do have depression & anxiety that has been treated in the past, but there are periods of time where my mental health requires me to take a day or days from work or that i'm more low-energy at work
                    and that i may keep to myself. 
                </p>
                <p>i am enthusiastic about plants! at home, i have cacti, aloe vera, a pothos, snake plant, coleus, and all of them have names. i have a lot of feelings about dungeons and dragons and storytelling and frequently 
                    play campaigns and oneshots with my friends over the weekend (i DM!). i like drawing and writing, and sometimes i watch television/movies/etc.
